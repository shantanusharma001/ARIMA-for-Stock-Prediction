# ARIMA-for-Stock-Prediction
Note: The weekly stock data was downloaded from yahoo finance. This makes the forecast into the future equivalent to weeks. 

## About the project
Forecasting is something I decided i should do as it ties in very with my academic and personal interests. Furthermore, I decided to forecast stocks as there is nothing better to predict than something seemingly random. Similar to my other project below I have compiled a list of resources I found useful.

## Useful Resources
1. First resource I used was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2khrpVo6qI" target="_top">this lecture</a> on youtube by Ani Katchova. This is a great start as it explains the theory behind ARIMA models along with the importance of ACFs and PACFs as well as why certain steps are carried out such as differencing

2. The next resource was <a href="https://www.machinelearningplus.com/time-series/arima-model-time-series-forecasting-python/#:~:text=ARIMA%2C%20short%20for%20'AutoRegressive%20Integrated,to%20predict%20the%20future%20values." target="_top">this blog post</a> It was very helpful in explaining how to use the model for real life predictions as well as an introduction into SARIMAs and how to use different modules to find all the optimal parameters ( I didn't end up using these but it was good to know). 

3. Lastly I found <a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/make-sample-forecasts-arima-python/" target="_top">this website </a> which I used to understand how to use the forecast methods from the stats module in more detail which allowed me to make in sample and out of sample forecasts.
